### Google Hiring Team for Business Data Science


**Subject: Application for Senior Business Data Scientist, Behavioral Economics (Spanish, English)**

Dear Google Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the **Senior Business Data Scientist, Behavioral Economics** position. With over 12 years of experience applying rigorous **empirical analysis** and **advanced statistical modeling** for leading international organizations (IDB, WBG, UNDP) and the Mexican federal government, I possess the unique quantitative expertise necessary to **shape Google’s business and technical strategies** by translating complex data into actionable product and business decisions.

My background is a direct fit for the role's dual mandate of technical depth and behavioral insight:

### 1. Quantitative Rigor and Data Curation (The 'How')

My core strength lies in leveraging **large-scale datasets** to derive insights, meeting your minimum requirements for coding and data proficiency.

* I am proficient in **Python** and **R** for statistical modeling and ETL, and I utilize **SQL** for querying databases, complementing my deep econometric foundation in STATA.
* I have extensive experience in **data curation and validation**, leading the quality control process for global surveys (WBG's FAT project), which is crucial for ensuring data integrity.
* My technical expertise extends to implementing algorithmic solutions for complex data challenges. For instance, I **developed advanced data science methods** to link and process massive confidential census data, implementing the **Levenshtein Edit Distance algorithm** to accurately code business group names and measure **market concentration**.

### 2. Behavioral Economics and Business/Product Impact (The 'Why')

My work in policy and economics provides a solid foundation for understanding **user behavior** and **incentives**, which is central to a Behavioral Economics role.

* I specialize in **hypothesis testing** through quasi-experimental designs to measure the causal impact of policy, a skill directly transferable to designing and interpreting **A/B tests** and evaluating solution deployment across teams.
* My research has focused on fundamental questions about **user behavior** and **incentives**, such as analyzing the effect of social programs on labor participation and evaluating the **welfare implications** of policy shifts (VAT vs. cash transfers).
* I excel at transforming abstract economic findings into concrete **business recommendations** and **developing metrics** for decision-makers. My work on quantifying **nearshoring opportunities** in Latin America and measuring market power provided strategic intelligence that directly informed policy and investment strategy.

### 3. Collaboration and Communication

My experience managing high-stakes projects within **cross-functional** teams at the Ministry of Economy and the World Bank demonstrates my ability to collaborate with engineers, product managers, and business associates. As a native **Spanish and fully fluent English speaker**, I am ideally equipped to drive product and business insights for the Mexican and broader Latin American markets.

I am confident that my deep quantitative expertise, proven capability in advanced data processing, and experience in translating analytical findings into strategic recommendations will allow me to immediately contribute to Google’s success. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.
