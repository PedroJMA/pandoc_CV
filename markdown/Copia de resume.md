Publications and work in progress
--------------------------------

2024 
: Martínez Alanis, P.J., Samuel Rosenow, and Carlos Zafra "**Nearshoring Opportunities in Latin America**", Mimeo. 
This note lays out the **analytical framework** used to identify **nearshoring** potential in Mexico, Central American countries , Colombia and Peru. 

2021
: [El Efecto del Programa "Jóvenes Construyendo el Futuro (JCF)" durante la Pandemia](https://www.gob.mx/conasami/documentos/el-efecto-del-programa-jovenes-construyendo-el-futuro-durante-la-pandemia-283604), Conasami
This paper evaluates the employment program JCF. On average, program graduates have
twice as likely to find a job compared to those not in the program (46.2% vs 23.6%) during the Covid-19 pandemic. This involved **data analysis**.

2020
: Martínez Alanis, P.J. "Growth constraints in the Mexican manufacturing establishments", Mimeo. 
Establishments over 20 years of age in Mexico stop growing and their **productivity** stagnates compared to younger establishments (Hsieh-Klenow, 2014). What are the factors that limit the growth of manufacturing establishments in Mexico? This paper analyzes the effect of distortions or frictions in the allocation of capital on the growth profile of Mexican manufacturing establishments. This involved **empirical analysis**.

2012
: Martínez Alanis, P.J."[Distorsiones regionales en la asignación de recursos y productividad de las manufacturas en México](https://estudioseconomicos.colmex.mx/index.php/economicos/article/view/96)", Estudios Económicos 2012.
This paper decomposes the regional effects of **resource misallocation** on **aggregate total factor productivity** (TFP), as a variant of the Hsieh-Klenow (2009) model. Using **establishment level data** from the 2004 Mexican Economic Census, I calculate the potential regional TFP gains in Manufacturing. 
<!-- The results suggest that: (i) capital misallocation is the primary source of regional misallocation in the sector; and (ii) resource misallocation within regions is the most important component in manufacturing TFP gains. -->
