--------------------------------

2025 : Arias Vazquez, F.J; Choudhary, R; and Martínez Alanis, P.J. "**Welfare Analysis of a Zero VAT Rate versus Cash Transfers in Mexico**". Working Paper.
This study compares the welfare implications of a zero VAT rate policy on basic goods versus a direct cash transfer program. Using data from the 2022 ENIGH, the model estimates a demand system to recover indirect utility functions, identifying optimal transfer amounts to maximize social welfare.

2024 : Martínez Alanis, P.J., Samuel Rosenow, and Carlos Zafra "**Nearshoring Opportunities in Latin America**", Mimeo.
This note establishes the **analytical framework** used to identify **nearshoring** potential in Mexico and Latin America, based on revealed comparative advantages and sectoral analysis.

Empirical analysis on why mature establishments in Mexico stop growing and their productivity stagnates, focusing on capital allocation frictions.
