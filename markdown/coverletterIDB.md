Dear IDB Recruiter, \

I am writing to express my interest in the position as **Consultant to support the work of the Regional Economic Advisor in CID (Job Number: 2400000015)** . 
With my experience of more than **12 years** as an economist performing empirical analysis for international organizations and the Mexican government,  and with broad expertise on the evaluation of policies that promote innovation, technology adoption, productivity, digital inclusion, firm's resilience to trade under supply disruptions in developing countries,  I believe I would make a valuable contribution to the **Regional Economic Advisor in CID**.\

As a former core team member of the firm-level adoption of technology (FAT) project, I have invaluable firsthand experience in the survey deployment, preparation of questionnaires, quality checks, data management and performing descriptive and econometric analysis that contributed to the flagship report [Bridging the Technological Divide: Technology Adoption by Firms in Developing Countries](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/d5d4d6f5-054c-5266-aa89-4e78ad5dbbe0/content).
Ever since this experience, I have aspired to be part of the World Bank Group. \

My academic formation encompass **two Masters degrees in Economics**, from El Colegio de México in 2004 and Western University in 2018, and also PhD studies in Economics from Western University and UC Davis. 
My postgraduate studies have allowed me to develop the necessary analytical tools to perform research through the lens of firm-level data from administrative records, economic census and firm surveys in developing countries, to estimate productivity, market power, monopsony power, and to quantify the misallocation of production factors. 
As an economist working for the Mexican federal government, I have lead the preparation of policy reports and working papers on the global economy and present research findings to audiences in the private and public sector. Also, I have experience in the design of impact evaluations of public policies. 
As a former research fellow and research assistant, I have engaged with experts at the World Bank, IFC, IDB, UNDP, in Washington, DC, and Mexico city. These professional experiences have given me the opportunity to developed and refined my research abilities to deliver results on time and work in intercultural environments. \

I would be thrilled to contribute as an **Consultant Economist** to the 
**Regional Economic Advisor in CID (Job Number 2400000015)** with my skills and experience. I have attached a copy of my resume with additional information about my qualifications. 
Thank you for your consideration, and look forward to speaking with you soon about this exciting professional opportunity. \
