Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) \
Mexico City, Mexico \
**Re: Application for Consultor/a Economico (Job Number: 1267)** \

\vspace{0.5cm}

Dear Members of the Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the **Consultor/a Economico (Job Number: 1267)** position within the IDB's Representation Office in Mexico, a role for which my 12+ years of experience in economic analysis, particularly focused on the Mexican economy, makes me a uniquely qualified candidate. Having previously contributed to the Bank's mission for over six years, I am intimately familiar with its high standards for analytical rigor and its strategic objectives in the region. \

The core responsibilities of this position align directly with my professional background. As Chief Economist for Mexico's National Minimum Wage Commission, I was directly responsible for coordinating monthly economic outlook reports to monitor key labor market and macroeconomic dynamics, including inflation, fiscal policy, and the country's financial programming. This experience has provided me with a deep, practical understanding of the data collection, processing, and analysis required to produce the regular, high-quality economic reports mentioned in the job description. \

Furthermore, my background is strongly aligned with the strategic aspects of the role. At the Ministry of Economy, I led the design, monitoring, and evaluation of key public policies, including the national nearshoring strategy. Crucially, during my previous tenure at the IDB, I contributed directly to the foundational empirical research that underpinned flagship reports and informed the dialogue for Mexico’s Country Strategy (EBP). I am confident this experience would allow me to quickly integrate and add value to the preparation of strategic documents and the Bank's knowledge agenda. \

My robust quantitative and econometric skills, demonstrated in my recent working paper analyzing the welfare effects of VAT policy using a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model, are complemented by a high level of proficiency in STATA, Python, and R. This technical expertise ensures I can autonomously manage all phases of the research process, from handling large datasets to delivering policy-relevant insights. \

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my experience back to the IDB and contribute to the vital work of the Regional Economic Advisor's office. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.
