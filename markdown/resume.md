Mexican government work experience: 3 years and 8 months
--------------------------------

Feb'21-May'23 : **Chief economist**, [National Minimum Wage Commission](https://www.gob.mx/conasami). 
I coordinated a monthly economic outlook report on the Mexican economy to keep track of labor market dynamics, purchasing power of wages, impact of the minimum wage, GDP, industrial activity, inflation expectations, informality, monetary and fiscal policies, exchange rates, balance of payments, and perspectives on main trading partners. 
For annual reports [2021](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/683861/Anexo_Informe_Anual_2021_vf.pdf) and [2022](https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/781706/Anexo_Informe_Anual_2022.pdf), I contributed with empirical strategies to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 in the female labor participation in Mexico, to estimate the gender wage gap during the Covid-19 pandemic, to evaluate the employment program [Jovenes construyendo el futuro](https://www.gob.mx/conasami/documentos/el-efecto-del-programa-jovenes-construyendo-el-futuro-durante-la-pandemia-283604) in the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, to evaluate the impact of the minimum wage increase in the gender wage gap in Mexico. Also, empirical analysis and estimation of monopsony power in manufacturing industries, and estimation of the pass-through of wages in production prices using confidential manufacturing firm-level data in a context of high inflation.

I provided intellectual leadership contributing to the design, evaluation, coordination and implementation of main public policies in Mexico by Vice Minister of Industry, Commerce and Competitiveness, [Ernesto Acevedo](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/e/ernesto-acevedo). For example, a New Industrial Policy; a new relocation strategy (nearshoring) of global value chains under the T-MEC; public policy recommendations to respond to the economic and health crisis in the aftermath of the Covid-19 outbreaks and coordinating the General Economic Incidence Group to monitor the Mexican economy with high-frequency data (persons, goods and financial markets).

Aug'13-Apr'14: **Research Assistant** for the Vice Presidency for Sector and Knowledge (VPS) based in Mexico city. Under the leadership of [Santiago Levy](https://www.brookings.edu/people/santiago-levy/), I performed empirical research for the project “Productividad, informalidad, ilegalidad y tama$\~{n}$o de los establecimientos” using micro data from Mexican Economic Census 1998, 2003 and 2008.

Under the direction of [J. Ernesto L$\'{o}$pez-C$\'{o}$rdova](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/people/e/ernesto-lopez-cordova), we analyze the effects of financial access in manufacturing, retail and services sectors in Mexico, and its impact on aggregate productivity. Using establishment level data from the economic census and with emphasis on the regional allocation of the factors, we seek to contribute to the IDB’s policy dialogue with federal states in Mexico. Empirical research project: "Productividad, cambio estructural y acceso al financiamiento en M$\'{e}$xico".


Feb'10-Aug'11: **Research Assistant** for VPS based in Mexico city. 
Under the leadership of Santiago Levy and the direction of Chang-tai Hsieh, I was a research assistant to understand to what extent Mexico is poor because resources are used inefficiently within the country using establishment level data from the Mexican Economic Census (1999-2004-2009). Applying the Hsieh-Klenow ([QJE, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1403)) model to the Mexican economy, we seek to answer how the misallocation of inputs across firms and industries is related to informality and aggregate total factor productivity.

As part of the project [Aligning Learning Incentives](https://www.iadb.org/en/whats-our-impact/ME-T1114), I was in charge of following up each one of 50 thousand students in the program across 88 schools in Mexico.

Under the leadership of Santiago Levy Algazi I explored the relationship between social programs, informality and economic growth in Mexico.

Sep'05-Jun'07: **Research Fellow** for the Integration and Trade Department, based in Washington, DC.

2023 
: Martínez Alanis, P.J., Samuel Rosenow, and Carlos Zafra "**Nearshoring Opportunities in Latin America**", Mimeo. 
This note lays out the analytical framework used to identify nearshoring potential in Mexico, Central American countries , Colombia and Peru. 

2021
: [El Efecto del Programa "Jóvenes Construyendo el Futuro (JCF)" durante la Pandemia](https://www.gob.mx/conasami/documentos/el-efecto-del-programa-jovenes-construyendo-el-futuro-durante-la-pandemia-283604), Conasami
This paper evaluates the employment program JCF. On average, program graduates have
twice as likely to find a job compared to those not in the program (46.2% vs 23.6%) during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

2020
: Martínez Alanis, P.J. "Growth constraints in the Mexican manufacturing establishments", Mimeo. 
Establishments over 20 years of age in Mexico stop growing and their productivity stagnates compared to younger establishments (Hsieh-Klenow, 2014). What are the factors that limit the growth of manufacturing establishments in Mexico? This paper analyzes the effect of distortions or frictions in the allocation of capital on the growth profile of Mexican manufacturing establishments. 

2012
: Martínez Alanis, P.J."[Distorsiones regionales en la asignación de recursos y productividad de las manufacturas en México](https://estudioseconomicos.colmex.mx/index.php/economicos/article/view/96)", Estudios Económicos 2012.
This paper decomposes the regional effects of resource misallocation on aggregate total factor productivity (TFP), as a variant of the Hsieh-Klenow (2009) model. Using establishment level data from the 2004 Mexican Economic Census, I calculate the potential regional TFP gains in Manufacturing. The results suggest that: (i) capital misallocation is the primary source of regional misallocation in the sector; and (ii) resource misallocation within regions is the most important component in manufacturing TFP gains.
